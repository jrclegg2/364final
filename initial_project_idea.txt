For this application, my goal is to expand upon my midterm and grab an idea from
an earlier homework, in which we created lists with priorities that you could update.
However, for this application, you will be able to rank the songs in order,
and save them into a playlist with their rankings. I also hope to include the link
to spotify for each song that a user may have saved. So, more simply, this app
will allow users to login, view the songs and playlists that they have saved,
and then rank these songs within each playlist and compare them to the average
ratings that other users have given it on the website. I also hope to include
something like a highest rated songs page, so users can see how other users
are rating the songs in the database!
